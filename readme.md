# Code2Prompt

A lightweight Python CLI tool designed to aggregate your codebase into a single, formatted string. This is ideal for providing context to any Large Language Model.

**Code2Prompt** automatically respects your `.gitignore` rules, ensuring you don't leak secrets, binary files, or unnecessary libraries (like `node_modules` or `venv`) into your prompt.
